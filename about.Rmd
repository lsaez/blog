title: "About this blog"
description: |
  This blog was created to bridge a gap in education, between university researchers and real-world practice. I've worked at universities for 15+ years, and before that, I was a real-world special education teacher, learning disabilities specialist, and childcare provider. Recently, I've been wondering how educational research could be better communicated to practice because, honestly, it requires some tricky translation. So, I invite you to join me as I explore issues centered on preschool and school learning, with the goal of sharing thought-provoking research evidence & ideas, as well as connect you to some great resources created by others. I hope to inspire you, as well, to have learning on the mind! ðŸ˜€
